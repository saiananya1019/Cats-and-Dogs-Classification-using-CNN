# Cats and Dogs Classification using CNN 🐱🐶

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images of cats and dogs. Users can upload an image, and the model will predict whether it is a cat or a dog.

## 📌 Features
- Image classification using CNN
- Accepts image uploads for prediction
- Trained on a dataset of cats and dogs
- High accuracy in distinguishing between the two

## 📂 Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cats-and-dogs-classification.git
   cd cats-and-dogs-classification  
2. you can easily the run the project using a google colab.

🚀 Usage
Upload an image of a cat or dog.
The model will process the image and predict whether it is a Cat or Dog.
Results will be displayed along with confidence scores.

📊 Model Details
CNN architecture with multiple convolutional layers.
Trained on a labeled dataset of cat and dog images.
Uses TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning.
